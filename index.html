<p class="azul">Immortal temptation
    Takes over my mind, condemned
    Falling weak on my knees
    Summon the strength of mayhem
    I am the storm that is approaching
    Provoking black clouds in isolation
    I am reclaimer of my name
    Born in flames, I have been blessed
    My family crest is a demon of death
    Forsakened, I am awakened
    A phoenix's ash in dark divine
    Descending misery
    Destiny chasing time
    Inherit the nightmare, surrounded by fate
    Can't run away
    Keep walking the line, between the light
    Led astray
    Through vacant halls I won't surrender
    The truth revealed in eyes of ember
    We fight through fire and ice forever
    Two souls once lost, and now they remember
    I am the storm that is approaching
    Provoking black clouds in isolation
    I am reclaimer of my name
    Born in flames, I have been blessed
    My family crest is a demon of death
    Forsakened, I am awakened
    A phoenix's ash in dark divine
    Descending misery
    Destiny chasing time
    Disappear into the night
    Lost shadows left behind
    Obsession's pulling me
    Fading, I've come to take what's mine
    Lurking in the shadows under veil of night
    Constellations of blood pirouette
    Dancing through the graves of those who stand at my feet
    Dreams of the black throne I keep on repeat
    A derelict of dark, summoned from the ashes
    The puppet master congregates all the masses
    Pulling strings, twisting minds as blades hit
    You want this power? Then come try and take it
    Beyond the tree, fire burns
    Secret love, bloodline yearns
    Dark minds embrace, crimson joy
    Does your dim heart heal or destroy?
    Bury the light deep within
    Cast aside, there's no coming home
    We're burning chaos in the wind
    Drifting in the ocean all alone

    <p class="vermelho">I'll endure the exile
    I'll endure the exile
    The darkness of night falls around my soul
    And the hunter within loses control
    Gotta let it out, gotta let it out
    Gotta let it out, gotta let it out
    This demon inside has ahold of me
    Clenching its power, trying to break free
    Gotta let it out, gotta let it out
    Gotta let it out, gotta let it out
    Move fast baby, don't be slow
    Step aside, reload, time to go
    I can't seem to control
    All this rage that's inside me
    Pullin' shots, aimin' dots, yeah, I don't miss
    Branded by fire, born in the abyss
    Red hot temper, I just can't resist
    All this vengeance inside me
    All of these thoughts runnin' through my head
    Arm on fire, veins burnin' red
    Frustration is gettin' bigger
    Bang, bang, bang, pull my Devil Trigger
    Embrace the darkness that's within me
    No hiding in the shadows anymore
    When this wickedness consumes me
    Nothing can save you and there's no way out
    I'm a wildfire you won't tame
    Igniting my temper, can't put out my flame
    There's no way to contain
    This storm swelling inside me
    I'm a bomb you can't defuse
    Might just accept you're gonna lose
    Can't turn down, I refuse
    To hold back anymore
    All of these voices inside of my head
    Blinding my sight in a curtain of red
    Frustration is getting bigger
    Bang, bang, bang, pull my Devil Trigger
    When the night ends, it's not over
    We fight through to get closer
    Like a silver bullet piercing through
    I throw myself into you
    All of these voices inside of my head
    Blinding my sight in a curtain of red
    Frustration is getting bigger
    Bang, bang, bang, pull my Devil Trigger</p>
